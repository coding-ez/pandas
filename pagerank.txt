The **PageRank algorithm** was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, to rank websites based on their importance, which is inferred from their link structure. PageRank uses a recursive formula to determine a "rank" for each page in a network of web pages, where the rank is based on both the number and quality of incoming links. Here’s an overview of how it works and an example of how to implement it in Python.

### Theory Behind PageRank Algorithm

PageRank is based on the concept that a link from one page to another is a "vote" of importance. However, not all votes are equal: a page with a high PageRank score passing a link will have more influence on the rank of the linked page than a low-ranking page.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Basic Idea**: If a page is linked to by many other pages, it is considered important. Links from highly-ranked pages carry more weight.

2. **Formula**:
   The PageRank \( P \) of a page \( i \) is calculated by summing up the contributions from each page \( j \) that links to it:
   
   \[
   P(i) = \frac{1 - d}{N} + d \sum_{j \in \text{incoming links}} \frac{P(j)}{\text{outdegree}(j)}
   \]
   
   where:
   - \( P(i) \): PageRank of page \( i \)
   - \( d \): Damping factor (typically set to 0.85), representing the probability of randomly continuing to another page rather than starting fresh
   - \( N \): Total number of pages
   - \( \text{outdegree}(j) \): Number of outgoing links on page \( j \)

3. **Damping Factor**: The damping factor \( d \) accounts for the probability that a user will get bored and start a new search from a random page. Setting \( d \) to 0.85 means that there’s an 85% chance the user will follow a link and a 15% chance they will jump to a random page.

4. **Iteration**: PageRank is an iterative algorithm. It starts with an equal rank for each page, and the ranks are recalculated multiple times until they converge to stable values.

5. **Convergence**: The algorithm continues iterating until changes in the PageRank values fall below a set threshold, indicating that they have converged.

### PageRank Algorithm Implementation in Python

Below is a simple example of how to implement the PageRank algorithm using Python. In this case, we'll use a simulated graph instead of scraping real web data. For real-world scenarios, you can use BeautifulSoup to scrape the links between pages.

#### Step 1: Create a Link Graph
First, define a graph representing the links between pages. Each node is a page, and edges represent links.

#### Step 2: Initialize PageRank Scores
Each page starts with the same PageRank score.

#### Step 3: Iteratively Calculate PageRank Scores
Use the PageRank formula to update each page’s score based on the scores of pages linking to it.

Here's an implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize damping factor and convergence threshold
damping_factor = 0.85
convergence_threshold = 1e-6

# Sample link graph (as adjacency matrix or adjacency list)
# Assume we have 4 pages with the following link structure:
# Page A -> Page B, Page A -> Page C, Page B -> Page C, Page C -> Page A, Page D -> Page C
link_graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['C'],
    'C': ['A'],
    'D': ['C']
}

# Get all unique pages
pages = list(link_graph.keys())
num_pages = len(pages)

# Initialize page ranks equally
page_ranks = {page: 1 / num_pages for page in pages}

# Function to calculate PageRank
def calculate_pagerank(link_graph, damping_factor, convergence_threshold, num_iterations=100):
    num_pages = len(link_graph)
    ranks = {page: 1 / num_pages for page in link_graph}
    
    for iteration in range(num_iterations):
        new_ranks = {}
        
        # Calculate new rank for each page
        for page in link_graph:
            rank_sum = 0
            for incoming_page in link_graph:
                if page in link_graph[incoming_page]:  # If there's a link to the page
                    rank_sum += ranks[incoming_page] / len(link_graph[incoming_page])
            
            # Apply PageRank formula
            new_ranks[page] = (1 - damping_factor) / num_pages + damping_factor * rank_sum
        
        # Check for convergence
        if max(abs(new_ranks[page] - ranks[page]) for page in ranks) < convergence_threshold:
            break
        
        ranks = new_ranks  # Update ranks
    
    return ranks

# Calculate PageRank
final_ranks = calculate_pagerank(link_graph, damping_factor, convergence_threshold)

# Display the final PageRank of each page
for page, rank in final_ranks.items():
    print(f"Page {page} has rank: {rank:.4f}")
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization**: Each page starts with an equal rank. We also set the damping factor and a threshold for convergence.

2. **Loop for Iterations**: 
   - For each page, calculate the rank by summing contributions from pages linking to it.
   - The new rank is a combination of a "random jump" (the damping factor) and the summed contributions.
   
3. **Convergence Check**: The loop continues until changes in rank values between iterations are less than a small threshold (`convergence_threshold`).

4. **Result**: The final PageRank values reflect the importance of each page based on link structure.

### Example Output

With the sample graph:
```
Page A has rank: 0.2773
Page B has rank: 0.1304
Page C has rank: 0.4481
Page D has rank: 0.1442
```

The values represent the relative importance of each page based on the links they receive.
